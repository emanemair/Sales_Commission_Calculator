# Sales Commission Calculator

## Description

This Java application calculates the earnings of a salesperson based on the items sold during the last week. The company pays its salespeople a base salary of $200 per week plus a commission of 9% on their gross sales. The application inputs the items sold by a salesperson and calculates their total earnings accordingly.

## Example Calculation

For example, if a salesperson sells $5,000 worth of merchandise in a week:
- Base salary: $200
- Commission (9% of $5,000): $450
- Total earnings: $200 + $450 = $650

## How to Use

1. **Input**: Provide a list of items sold by the salesperson.
2. **Output**: The application will calculate and display the salespersonâ€™s total earnings for the week.

There's no limit to the number of items that can be sold, making the application flexible for varying sales volumes.

## Implementation Details

- This application is implemented in Java.
- It handles input of item values and computes earnings based on a predefined commission structure.
- It demonstrates basic input/output operations and arithmetic calculations in Java.
